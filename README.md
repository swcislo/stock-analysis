# VBA Challenge

## Purpose and Background
 Code was originally written to analyze stock results from 2017 and 2018 for company DQ. After the produced results were review, a request was made to refactor the code to allow it to be used for analysis of the entire stock market for the last several years.

## Results
The results from 2017 for the 12 stocks analyzed were almost all positive results. All but one yielded positive returns. 

The results from 2018 for the same 12 stocks had negative results. Only two stocks had a positive return. 

### Summary
Refactoring code has the potential to be a timesaver if the style and format is similiar to your style. Depending on the style and the efficiency of the code you are refactoring, it has the potential to be a time saver or time waster.
